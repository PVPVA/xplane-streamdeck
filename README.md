# X-Plane Stream Deck Manager
![main screen](misc/main.jpg)

This is a manager for X-Plane <-> Elgato Stream Deck connection. Developed in Python 3.10 for X-Plane 11 & **X-Plane 12**.

This software includes rich set of features for robust control of the simulator cockpit.

Developed with the idea taking away mouse controlling of most of the cockpit, 
works the best together with other simulator peripherals (e.g. radio, A/P panel etc.)

**Supported planes:**
- Boeing 737 NG by **Zibo**
- Cessna 172 by Laminar Research

Working across all Stream Deck versions, but ready to use configurations are made for the XL version.
You can configure it for any kind of plane, though.

### Features:
- Fast & high performance sync with X-Plane's dataref to visually depict the actual state
- Multiple dataref states with each custom key image
- Directories
- Toggle actions (single command)
- Multiple command actions
- Momentary switches
- Push / Release actions
- Supporting multi-position switches or knobs control via single button (cycling positions)
- Custom, configurable labels
- **Displays**
- **Gauges**
- **500+ custom-made icons** for the 737 NG, Cessna 172 and more

All of these features can be configured in simple YAML configs. YAML is very easy to use
and simple format similar to JSON, but more human-readable and harder to cause a syntax error in.

### Dependencies
- NumPy
- PyYAML
- streamdeck - Windows requires additional DLL's installed in directory under %PATH% variable (LibUSB HIDAPI)
- Pillow
- pyxpudpserver

## Installation
Instructions for **Windows**

1. **Download and install Python 3 (3.10 minimum recommended)**

- *choosing the option to add Python to %PATH% and removing the %PATH% length limit is **recommended***
- both are options during installation, otherwise you might have to include absolute path to Python to launch the script

2. **Clone this repository by:**
- clone by git on your machine by `git clone https://github.com/wortelus/xplane-streamdeck.git`
- or download source code by **Download ZIP** and extract the files
- or download the latest stable release under the **Releases** section
3. *(Optional step)* - **Add your custom font in the fonts directory**
- current one set is OFL font **IBMPlexMono**
- the name the script will try to open is written in **config.yaml**
- Custom labels and displays have their own definitions in plane configurations
- The script searches first the `fonts/` directory of the program, then `C:/Windows/Fonts`
- **MS33558** optional
- You can download it from the internet, this repository doesn't redistribute it.
4. **Install the dependencies by**

`.../xplane-streamdeck> python -m pip install -r dependencies.txt`

using cmd or PowerShell

5. **Install LibUSB HIDAPI**

- The *streamdeck* package requires LibUSB HIDAPI, install it by following this 
[guide](https://python-elgato-streamdeck.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/backend_libusb_hidapi.html)
from the official documentation source

6. **Update `config.yaml` for your preferences and enable UDP server in X-Plane settings**
- Mainly update the **serial number** of your Stream Deck with your **serial 
number** and number of keys according to your model. 
- Execute the xplane-streamdeck script to find the serial number out
- Check the font, IP addresses / ports and X-Plane's UDP server status in case of a problem
7. **Add the streamdeck handlers to `X-Plane 11\Resources\plugins\FlyWithLua\Scripts`**
- Ensure you have **FlyWithLua** installed
- Copy the streamdeck_handler_*[plane code]*.lua files from the `misc/` directory

## Usage
Instructions for **Windows**

Choose desired plane type configuration in `config.yaml`

**Execute the script by running the `main.py` with Python 3 by:**

running `.../xplane-streamdeck> python .\main.py` under the *xplane-streamdeck* directory, 
while having the Stream Deck plugged in already

Run the script anytime after the aircraft loads in the simulator, the script can be restarted anytime without harm.

The program supports image caching, which saves several seconds of image preloading during launch
- To enable it, set `cache-path` field in `config.yaml`
- To disable, just remove the field or leave it blank
- NOTE: If you are tweaking your image set or configuration, it is recommended disable this feature 
to always see the up-to-date configuration state (or simply remove it, but the cache will be recreated).
- **Old cache with new icon set, configuration, font etc. can often cause funky behavior or crashes.**

### How it works
- The streamdeck Python library provides modular access
- X-Plane has its simple, yet powerful UDP protocol for communication with the external applications 
- You define your yaml configurations and icons 
- Only the needed files, icons and configurations are loaded into RAM 
- The software then efficiently runs in background updating your buttons and responding to state changes of the buttons 
- Performance hit is expected to be under 0.1%, while **updating 20x per second**
- You can change the update rate in the `main.py`

### Key Creation and Configuration
**Refer to the `docs/plane_keys_configuration.md` for a guide on how to create/edit buttons.**

### What is planned / WIP?
- Backward compatible GUI Drag 'n Drop utility for managing the plane presets
- Own X-Plane UDP handler

### Known Issues
- There was a bug in **pyxpudpserver** that sometimes caused the dataref updating of buttons to
freeze, giving you a message:
`
RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
`

    The following proposed solution [has been merged](https://github.com/leleopard/pyXPUDPServer/pull/5) in version 1.2.8 of **pyxpudpserver**. If you get this error, update or reinstall your dependencies via *pip* instead of using the following [forked version with temporary fix](https://github.com/wortelus/pyXPUDPServer).

- There is a known risk of crashes associated with running Stream Deck through USB hubs:
```
    raise TransportError("Failed to write out report (%d)" % result)
StreamDeck.Transport.Transport.TransportError: Failed to write out report (-1) 
```

- If you break the config socket (IP address / port) settings or launch the xplane-streamdeck twice, you will get
this message.
```
The X-Plane UDP connection could not be initialized due to operating system error, this is probably caused by misconfiguration of port numbers or the xplane-streamdeck is launched twice.
